# Get Rid of The Virus
This game is created using pygame. The task of this game is to help JACK-JACK PARR get rid of the virus. 
Jack-jack Parr is the youngest son of Bob and Helen Parr, as well as the younger brother of Violet and Dash. 
He is a supporting character in The Incredibles and a major character in Incredibles 2. 
For the background music beat, I produced it using Garageband.
